class LocalBinaryPatterns:
    """
    Class which computes uniform local binary patterns as histograms on images.
    The local binary pattern is a texture feature which was proposed by Ojala
    et al.'s paper "Performance evaluation of texture measures with
    classification based on Kullback discrimination of distributions".
    It can either compute the features for a set of key points with "compute" or
    compute them on a dense grid with "detectAndCompute".
